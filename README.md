# To prevent any compatibility issues:

## !!! DO NOT MERGE THE BRANCH CALLED `netFramework5.0` !!!

This branch is for **.NET Framework 5.0 only**.

Any change on this branch **must be done** under the **version 5.0** of the .NET Framework.

If you want to modify this branch you must create another branch from the `netFramework5.0` one using as prefix `5.0/branch-name`.

Then you can open a PR to merge your modifications on `netFramework5.0`.
